# Project: 9router-app (9Router)

Local-first fork of `decolua/9router` — an OpenAI-compatible AI routing gateway + Next.js dashboard. Routes traffic across 40+ upstream providers with format translation, model-combo fallback, multi-account fallback, OAuth/API-key credential management, token refresh, and quota/usage tracking.

Two published artifacts in this one repo:
- **Dashboard + gateway** (root `package.json`, `9router-app`) — the Next.js server that does the actual routing.
- **CLI launcher** (`cli/`, published to npm as `9router`) — separate package, own version/build, installs/starts the server and manages the tray.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full system design and `open-sse/AGENTS.md` for the routing/translation engine's own conventions — read that before editing anything under `open-sse/`.

## Stack & Tech

- Plain JavaScript (ESM), **no TypeScript**. `@/*` path alias → `src/*` (`jsconfig.json`).
- Next.js (App Router) for the dashboard + `/v1/*` API routes.
- SQLite persistence under `src/lib/db/` with adapter fallback chain: `bun:sqlite` → `better-sqlite3` (optional native dep) → `node:sqlite` (Node ≥22.5) → `sql.js` (pure-JS, always works).
- Test runner: Vitest, in `tests/` — an **independent ESM package**, not wired into root `npm test`.
- Lint: ESLint (`eslint.config.mjs`, extends `eslint-config-next`).

## Commands

Dashboard/gateway (repo root):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm install
PORT=20128 NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:20128 npm run dev
npm run build && PORT=20128 HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 npm run start
```
Bun variants: `npm run dev:bun` / `build:bun` / `start:bun`. Default port **20128** (dashboard at `/dashboard`, API at `/v1`).

CLI package (`cli/`):
```bash
npm run cli:pack       # build + npm pack from root
cd cli && npm run dev  # nodemon watch
```

Tests (Homelab only):
Never run tests on Windows. All testing (targeted files, unit, UI and jsdom suites, integration, baseline scripts, and browser testing tools) must execute on the homelab.
See `docs/ops/NINEROUTER_HOMELAB_BUILD_TEST.md` and `docs/ops/NINEROUTER_DEV_DEPLOYMENT.md` for the authoritative test and build procedures.

The suite is not expected to be all-green on a plain checkout (~938 pass, ~64 fail). Judge regressions with `tests/__baseline__/verify-no-regression.mjs` on the homelab, not a raw run. Known failures live in `tests/__baseline__/known-fails.txt` plus environment-dependent files (`unit/embeddings.cloud.test.js` needs the out-of-repo `cloud/` worker, `unit/xai-oauth-service.test.js` needs live network, `real/*.real.test.js` need live provider credentials).

## Architecture

- `src/app/api/v1/*` (Next rewrite `/v1/*` → `/api/v1/*`) → `src/sse/handlers/chat.js` (parse, combo expansion, account-selection loop) → `open-sse/handlers/chatCore.js` (translate, dispatch, retry/refresh, stream) → `open-sse/executors/*` (per-provider upstream call) → `open-sse/translator/*` (client format ↔ provider format) → SSE back to client.
- `src/sse/` is app-side entry glue; `open-sse/` is the provider-agnostic engine (also usable standalone). Cross that boundary consciously.
- Translator pivots through **OpenAI as the intermediate format**; a translator registered on an exact `source:target` pair runs as a direct route, skipping the lossy double-hop. Translators self-register via `register(from, to, reqFn, resFn)` — new files MUST be imported in `open-sse/translator/index.js`.
- Provider registry: one file per provider in `open-sse/providers/registry/*`; `index.js` is auto-generated, don't hand-edit — regenerate with `scripts/migrate-registry.mjs`.
- `src/lib/localDb.js` is a backward-compat shim re-exporting `src/lib/db/index.js`; new code imports from `@/lib/db/index.js`. Per-entity logic in `src/lib/db/repos/*`. Schema/migrations in `src/lib/db/migrations/`.
- `open-sse/rtk/` (token saver) mutates request bodies in-place and is **fail-open** — any error returns null, body untouched, never throws.

## Code Style

- Plain JS/ESM, camelCase, config-driven — never hardcode model/role/block strings; use `open-sse/config/` + `open-sse/translator/schema/` constants.
- Match existing patterns in the file/module being touched. `custom-server.js` derives client IP from the TCP socket and strips attacker-controlled `X-Forwarded-For` — preserve this when touching request/IP/rate-limit code.
- Conventional Commits style (`fix(translator): …`, `feat(...)`). Root and `cli/` are versioned independently; log changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Important Rules

- NEVER commit `.env` files or secrets.
- Never suppress type/lint errors to force a green build.
- Security-sensitive env: `JWT_SECRET`, `INITIAL_PASSWORD` (default `123456` — must override in any real deployment), `API_KEY_SECRET`, `MACHINE_ID_SALT`. Full contract in `.env.example` / `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Binary/protobuf upstreams (kiro EventStream, cursor protobuf, commandcode NDJSON) don't round-trip through the OpenAI translator bridge — handle them inside their own executor.

## Gotchas

- **Do NOT run `npm run build` or any test commands on this Windows workstation.** Next.js production builds reliably fail/OOM here even with an increased Node heap, and test suites must run exclusively in the authoritative homelab environment.
  - **The homelab is the only authoritative build and test gate.** Full procedures: `docs/ops/NINEROUTER_HOMELAB_BUILD_TEST.md` (Docker build and test execution at `/home/itsnulla/9router-build` via `ssh homelab`) and `docs/ops/NINEROUTER_DEV_DEPLOYMENT.md` (safe deploy and verification to the `ninerouter-dev` dev container).
  - **Windows test execution is strictly prohibited.** Never run `npx vitest`, targeted test files, UI or jsdom suites, baseline verification scripts, or browser testing tools on Windows, and never make any claim of test pass or build status based on Windows test output.
- `tests/__baseline__/verify-no-regression.mjs` splits report paths on `"/app/"`, which is Docker-container-path-shaped and breaks on native Windows paths — run baseline comparisons on Linux/homelab, not Windows.
- `better-sqlite3` is an optional native dependency by design (see `src/lib/db/driver.js` fallback chain) so `npm install` never hard-fails without build tools — don't "fix" a missing native binding by making it a hard dependency.
- Homelab dev container (`ninerouter-dev`) mounts a persistent volume `9router-dev-data` at `/app/data` — never run `docker compose down -v`, `docker volume rm 9router-dev-data`, or otherwise touch that mount when deploying/rolling back.
